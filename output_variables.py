#The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
x = "Python testing"
print(x)
#In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma
x = "This"
y = "file"
z = "describes"
q = "output"
w = "variables"
print(x,y,z,q,w)
#You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
x = "This "
y = "file "
z = "describes "
q = "output "
w = "variables "
print(x+y+z+q+w)
#For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
x = 5
y = 10
print(x+y)
